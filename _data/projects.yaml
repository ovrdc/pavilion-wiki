    The idea is to have both a presence or absence sidewalk layer based on the regional LBRS and an actual sidewalk layer mapped from OSIP imagery and field data. The LBRS layer is 60% complete while we have only completed one city (Washington CH) for the sidewalk layer. An intern did most of the WCH layer, in the field and in the office using QGIS. She updated the LBRS points in WCH when she was in the field as well via Collector.

    This site is built from a csv file in the <code>_data</code> folder and a geojson that has been minified to topojson using mapshaper in the <code>_trails</code> folder. These files are created using a model in the project folder. The csv file is the attribute table of the dissolved trails layer. The project is built with Jekyll and hosted with Netlify, using nodejs netlify-cli <code>netlify-deploy</code> command from the root of the jekyll folder. The domains www.southernohiotrails.org, .com and www.sohiotrails.org and .com are registered with Hover. The Jekyll site needs jekyll-retinamagick insalled to crop the images correctly. This may mean installing GraphicsMagick and/or ImageMagick command line tools for windows.

    There are so many aspects to the maps portal, it is not possible to cover all those here. The key is looking through the <code>_layouts</code> and <code>_includes</code> folders for how to setup the maps. There are two main templates - the main Leaflet map template with the sidebar and toolbar and the MapboxGL template based on Google MDL Light. Both of these templates use of combination of Jekyll and jQuery to build the pages and dynamically update the sidebars.
  tasks:
    - name: Make all JS and CSS external resources local
    - name: Update Jekyll to new version and fix any posts that are written with <code>.js</code> extension
    - name: Move the /apps folder to its own subdomain at https://apps.ovrdc.org in attempts to separate the Wordpress site and the static sites. This would mean creating a redirect from www.ovrdc.org/apps to the new apps subdomain to keep all old links working.
    - name: Move the project off the old computer under my desk to Digital Ocean. This would mean working strickly from the command-line however.

- name: OVRDC Website Update
  details: >-
    The current website theme is one that is not updated through the Wordpress themes page, and needs changed. However, many of the "pages" are custom to this theme. I have narrowed down the new theme choices to OceanWP and Zerif Lite. Buckeye Hills uses Zerif Lite, but I think we could make ours sufficiently different with colors and styling. I am planning on doing this changeover live on the site, so it would need to be done in one day, and done fast. It should not be too much of an issue.

    The Wordpress website is automatically backed up to Google Drive (gis.ovrdc@gmail.com). This does not include the Jekyll Apps (/apps) or all the old static files from the old website. Those backups are stored on the removeable drive connected to the main RTPO computer.

  details: In one or more of the 2017 folders are the remnants of the old AOGDP website. To find the old links, look them up on the website archive, and make sure when you create the new pages on the new AOGDP blog to back date the posts so the old links work again.
